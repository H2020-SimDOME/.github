Welcome to SimDOME's GitHub organization!

# SimDOME project

SimDOME is an [EU H2020 project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/814492) that intends to develop an industry-ready software framework for materials modeling interoperability based on [EMMC](https://emmc.eu/) standards, such as the [Elementary Multiperspective Material Ontology](https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMO). Visit the [project's website](https://simdome.eu/) to learn more!

The project goals have materialized in the [SimPhoNy software framework](https://github.com/simphony), that aims to achieve interoperability using knowledge graphs as common language; the [SimDOME Open Simulation Platform](https://osp.simdome.eu/), a web application aimed at facilitating its use; and a number of modules (known as SimPhoNy wrappers) covering different industrial applications and materials modeling fields:

- [SimNanoDOME](https://github.com/simphony/SimNanoDOME) - a SimPhoNy wrapper intended to be used for investigating gas-phase nano-particle synthesis using a Direct-Current (DC) plasma source. 
- [COBRAMM Wrapper](https://github.com/simphony/CobrammWrapper) - enables modelling the electronic (UV-VIS) linear absorption (LA) spectrum of a solvated neutral molecule in its singlet ground state. 
- [SimCMCLKinetics](https://github.com/simphony/SimNanoDOME) - a SimPhoNy wrapper for the CMCL’s “kinetics & SRM Engine Suite” software.
- [Wet Synthesis](https://github.com/simphony/simdome_wet_synthesis) - A collection of wrappers around solvers to simulate the wet-synthesis of Ni-Mn-Co Hydroxides.

# SimDOME SDK

The SimDOME SDK is a collection of APIs, tutorials, documentation and templates that allow developers to integrate additional simulation engines, databases and data repositories in the SimDOME ecosystem. Follow [this link](./SDK.md) to learn more about the SimDOME SDK and its components.
