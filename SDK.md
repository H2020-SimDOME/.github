# SimDOME SDK

The SimDOME SDK is a collection of APIs, tutorials, documentation and templates that allow developers to integrate additional simulation engines, databases and data repositories in the SimDOME ecosystem.

- [SimPhoNy Wrapper API](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/developers/wrappers.html) - enables the creation of new SimPhoNy wrappers.

- [SimPhoNy Operations API](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/developers/operations.html) - allows developers to attach code snippets to ontology individuals.

- [SimPhoNy Wrapper Template](https://github.com/simphony/wrapper-development) - includes a simple implementation of a SimPhoNy wrapper to be used as a template, as well as template documentation.

- SimDOME GUI: source code - the SimDOME GUI is a A web-application that invokes fixed workflows using SimPhoNyâ€‹. The source code enables anybody to run their own instance of the SimDOME Open Simulation Platform, and modifying it makes it possible to add extra workflows to the application.

- SimDOME GUI: guide on adding extra workflows - a short guide pointing out the relevant parts of the GUI's source code that need to be modified in order to add extra workflows to the web application. 

- Ontology development guidelines - developing a SimPhoNy wrapper involves abstracting the concepts handled by thew software as terminological knowledge in an ontology. The scope of the guide is to help developers get started with ontology development.
